# About Us

## Who we are

We are an engineering team that helps entrepreneurs and startups build products from scratch, including mobile apps,
SaaS/websites, Chrome extensions, backends, and data analysis services.

We are interested in open source technologies.

Core members are from Google, Facebook, Uber, and silicon valley startups.


## What we do

We engage community members in two categories:

| Categories | Why & What we do |
| --- | --- |
| Core Developers | We are building community with open source software at [GitHub](https://github.com/stargately)  |
| Study Groups | [10x.pub System Design and Architecture](https://github.com/puncsky/system-design-and-architecture) |

## Community Culture

Think big and act on it
* Engineers build things anyway. Why not make them big?
* Bias toward action
* Build positive feedback loops
* Know our goals and situations, diagnosis them, and then work in both directions

Seek truth from facts
* Embrace radical transparency
* Input more and output more
* Deliberate practice and immediate feedback

Make magic
* Attention to detail
* Work long, smart, and hard to improve speed and quality
* Build 10x product with reusable frameworks, primitives, and processes

Extreme Ownership
* Success is in our own hands
* Sign our artwork
* Our success is symmetrical with our rewards

Customer Obsession
* Listen to our customers
* Be careful with root-level metrics
* We are representatives of our customers
* Make money to build better services, not the reverse
